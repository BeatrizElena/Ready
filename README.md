# Be Ready! An app for interpreters

# An App for Medical Interpreters at Dana Farber

#### Project Two from General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Class - Providence

###### Overview

This app is an individual project that has as its main requirements:

1. Engage in project scoping activities including including [wireframing](/Users/beatriz/wdi/projects/project2/ready-client/wireframe_project2.pdf), [user stories](/Users/beatriz/wdi/projects/project2/ready-client/user_stories_project2.pdf) and [ERDs](/Users/beatriz/wdi/projects/project2/ready-client/erd.pdf).
2. Create an API, hosted at https://ready-interpreter.herokuapp.com/.
3. Create a Front End, hosted at https://beatrizelena.github.io/Ready-Client.
4. Use AJAX, event handlers, a clear indication of CRUD actions the user can take.
5. Demonstrate knowledge of version control by maintaining a git workflow.
6. Style using scss and bootstrap.
7. Be a SPA application.
8. Write clear documentation.
9. Deploy to Github pages.
10. Deply to Heroku.



###### Technologies Used

- Ruby and Ruby on Rails
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- HTML5
- SCSS
- Bootstrap



###### Reflections on the Process

_Working Process_

I built the API first and tested its functionality with curl scripts, on localhost, and in the rails console.

The front end consisted of forms and submit actions that fired the separate CRUD events of creating, updating, viewing, and deleting resources.

_Unsolved Problems / Future Additions_

1. Adding the ability to search by doctor's name.
2. Adding the ability to search which doctors are affiliated to a specific clinic.
